Shortly after defending my bachelor thesis I watched this [TED-Talk] about
learning Chinese characters, so called Kanji, with ease. Doesn't seem so hard,
right? But after digging a little deeper into the Chinese language I decided
not to learn Chinese. Chapter closed.

1.5 years later in the middle of writing my master thesis and having the luxury
of pay TV I watched an anime called Sword Art Online. The storyline is quiet
simple. Boy gets trapped in a virtual reality death game, survives and goes back
to save his girlfriend. The show struck a nerve because the topic of my master
thesis was about virtual reality too. That must have been the time when I
decided to give Japanese a try.

Again 1.5 years later after failing to get a scholarship from the German
Academic Exchange Service I applied for a special PhD program including a
scholarship directly from Tsukuba University. The outcome was unclear so I also
decided to enter Erlangen University on an interim basis to study Japanese. At
this years' february I received message from the university to send additional
admission documents as I have been allowed to enter the PhD program in
Empowerment Informatics.
